The Goal is to build classification models for predicting whether a company will be acquired based on its historical financial data. Different types of models need to be evaluated. 

Models
•	Scikit-learn package: Linear SVM, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, MLP Classifier
•	PyTorch RNN moduel: 

The project compares various models based on the metrics such as accuracy and F1-Scores.
