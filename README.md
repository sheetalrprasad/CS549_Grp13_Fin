# CS549_Grp13_Fin

The Goal is to build classification models for predicting whether a company will be acquired based on its historical financial data. Different types of models need to be evaluated. 

Models
•	Scikit-learn package: 
•	PyTorch RNN moduel: 

Using three types of non-sequential models, e.g., logistic regression, SVM, feed-forward neural networks etc. 
A non-sequential model uses the features from the same year to predict `target`.

Different combinations of hyper parameters, especially for RNN-based sequential models need to be experimented and documented.
